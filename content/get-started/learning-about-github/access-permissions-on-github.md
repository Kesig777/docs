{% ifversion ghec %}
If an enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, members are provisioned as new personal accounts on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and are fully managed by the identity provider. The {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %} have read-only access to repositories that are not a part of their enterprise and cannot interact with users that are not also members of the enterprise. Within the organizations owned by the enterprise, the {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %} can be granted the same granular access levels available for regular organizations. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users).
